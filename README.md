This application allows a user to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer player. The user will be given a prompt welcoming them to the game and they will have the option to select either R, P, or S. The computer will then randomly choose on of the 3 options. After typing in their choice and selecting ok, the user will see their choice and the computers choice. The user will be prompted to click ok again and then they will see if the outcome is a Win, Loss, or Tie and will see their total scores for each. The user will then be prompted to choose whether they want to play again or not. If they choose to keep playing, their scores will save after each round. If the user chooses to stop playing, then the next time they load the application, the scores will be reset.
